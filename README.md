Evaluating the effectiveness of drug in alleviating Cognitive Impairment and Dementia risk in Diabetes project is dedicated to the health issues that are related to neurological disorders like Cognitive Imapirment and Dementia in Diabetic patients that emerged as acritical focal point. As a professional with educational background in Toxicology such topics captivated my interest. As memory problem don't just affect one person they have impact on families and community too. Therefore, I was curious to see if I can use my data analytical skills in working with data to help out in this area of research, because I believe if we figure out better ways to help people with diabetes in avoiding these memory issues, could make a big difference in people's lives. 

In this project, The research team used male rat models for the study and these rat models are divided into 3 groups: Sham( control with no drug and no surgery), Untreated - (with surgery only) (UCCAO- Unilateral Common Carotid Artery Occlusion has been done to make them diabetic) and Treated- (After surgery intranasal drug administered). The data has been recorded at baseline that is before surgery and after surgery till 34 week. And After surgery the intranasal drug (ETA antagonist that could block the ETA receptors which are responsible for these neurological disorders) has been administered in treated rats once in a day till 34 week and every week their behaviour test records are maintained to see how the animals of three group behave. So that we can conclude whether the drug effectively blocked the ETA receptors and help in reducing the Cognitive Impairment and Dementia problem in diabetes or not. For this project the test report data of two tests are used- 
*Novel object recognition (NOR) test, commonly used behavioral assay for the assessment of various aspects of learning and memory in rodents, with an emphasis on exploration & recognition memory.) 
*Plus maze test (This test is used to measure anxiety-like behavior or decision making ability in rodents.)


**Goal**

To check the efficacy of drug that could alleviate Cognitive Impairment and Dementia risk in diabetes.

**Features**

This project is committed to provide in depth information about neurological disorder like Cognitive Impairment and Dementia.

**Data Source**
Utilizes data collected from the Department of Pathology and Lab Medicine at the Medical University of South Carolina, including clinical research data from rat models. The analysis covers various aspects, including blood glucose, body weight, and behavioral tests (NOR and Plus maze).

**Data cleaning**
As the data were in the form of different tables, so I made a separate dataframe with all the columns that I required for my Hypothetical testing. Then I cleaned the dataframe to make an attempt to create machine learnining models like linear regression and logistic model.

**Hypothetical Testing**
Hypothetical testings are done with the data of Blood Glucose and Body weight of baseline, Also I used the data of baseline( before surgery) and at 34W( at 34 week) of two tests NOR test and Plus Maze test

**Data Visualization**
To understand the data, Data visualization is done with the help of Tableau to come to the conclusion about the effectiveness of drug on rat models.

**Regression Models**
An attempt was done to make the Logistic regression model and Linear Regression Model with this data set. But not satisfied with the result. As the dataset is very small so machine learning models were not looking effective in this case.

**Web Scraping**
Gathered suppliment information related to these neurological disorders like what are these disorders and their sign & symptoms and treatment etc., by scraping relevant website.

**Social and Scientific Significance:**

This project goes beyond scientific exploration; it addresses social responsibility by seeking practical ways to improve the lives of individuals with diabetes. The study aims to contribute meaningful insights through data analysis for better health outcomes.

### Conclusion:

- No significant difference in RI of rats at 34W in the NOR test, indicating no memory loss observed.
- Significant difference in Plus Maze test, suggesting the drug's positive impact on reducing anxiety and depressive behavior in rats.
- Inconclusive results regarding the drug's effectiveness in alleviating Cognitive Impairment and Dementia in diabetes due to limitations with the rat models.

 **Future Research Recommendations**:
- Explore the drug's effects on alternative rat models with a focus on memory testing.
- Investigate additional behavioral assays or tests that may provide a more comprehensive understanding of the drug's impact on Cognitive Impairment and Dementia in diabetes.
